# Ensure `conda` is available, wherever this agent happens to be running.

# Target-aware and idempotent, in three tiers:
#   1. conda already on PATH        -> no-op   (self-hosted image: instant)
#   2. previously bootstrapped here -> re-link (same sandbox, later conversation)
#   3. nothing                      -> install (OpenHands Cloud: ~30-60s, once)
#
# Why this exists: OpenHands Cloud's sandbox spec catalogue is read-only and
# holds only the stock agent-server image, so a custom conda image cannot be
# registered. Conda must therefore be installed at run time there. On the
# self-hosted image it is already baked in at /opt/conda and tier 1 exits
# immediately, so this script costs nothing on that path.
#
# Runs as the unprivileged `openhands` user: installs under $HOME, never
# touches /opt/conda (which is root-owned and read-only by design).
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/ensure-conda.sh   (safe to run repeatedly)
